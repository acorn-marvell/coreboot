config VBOOT_STARTS_IN_BOOTBLOCK
	bool "Vboot starts verifying in bootblock"
	default n
	depends on VBOOT_VERIFY_FIRMWARE
	help
	  Firmware verification happens during or at the end of bootblock.

config VBOOT_STARTS_IN_ROMSTAGE
	bool "Vboot starts verifying in romstage"
	default n
	depends on VBOOT_VERIFY_FIRMWARE && !VBOOT_STARTS_IN_BOOTBLOCK
	help
	  Firmware verification happens during or at the end of romstage.

config VBOOT2_MOCK_SECDATA
	bool "Mock secdata for firmware verification"
	default n
	depends on VBOOT_VERIFY_FIRMWARE
	help
	  Enabling VBOOT2_MOCK_SECDATA will mock secdata for the firmware
	  verification to avoid access to a secdata storage (typically TPM).
	  All operations for a secdata storage will be successful. This option
	  can be used during development when a TPM is not present or broken.
	  THIS SHOULD NOT BE LEFT ON FOR PRODUCTION DEVICES.

config VBOOT_DISABLE_DEV_ON_RECOVERY
	bool "Disable dev mode on recovery requests"
	default n
	depends on VBOOT_VERIFY_FIRMWARE
	help
	  When this option is enabled, the Chrome OS device leaves the
	  developer mode as soon as recovery request is detected. This is
	  handy on embedded devices with limited input capabilities.

config SEPARATE_VERSTAGE
	bool "Vboot verification is built into a separate stage"
	default n
	depends on VBOOT_VERIFY_FIRMWARE

config RETURN_FROM_VERSTAGE
	bool "The separate verification stage returns to its caller"
	default n
	depends on SEPARATE_VERSTAGE
	help
	  If this is set, the verstage returns back to the calling stage instead
	  of exiting to the succeeding stage so that the verstage space can be
	  reused by the succeeding stage. This is useful if a ram space is too
	  small to fit both the verstage and the succeeding stage.

config CHIPSET_PROVIDES_VERSTAGE_MAIN_SYMBOL
	bool "The chipset provides the main() entry point for verstage"
	default n
	depends on SEPARATE_VERSTAGE
	help
	  The chipset code provides their own main() entry point.

# These VBOOT_X_INDEX are the position of X in FW_MAIN_A/B region. The index
# table is created by cros_bundle_firmware at build time based on the positions
# of the blobs listed in fmap.dts and stored at the top of FW_MAIN_A/B region.
# Unfortunately, there is no programmatical link between the blob list and the
# index number here.
config VBOOT_ROMSTAGE_INDEX
	hex "Romstage component index"
	default 2
	depends on VBOOT_VERIFY_FIRMWARE
	help
	  This is the index of the romstage component in the verified
	  firmware block.

config VBOOT_RAMSTAGE_INDEX
	hex "Ramstage component index"
	default 1
	depends on VBOOT_VERIFY_FIRMWARE
	help
	  This is the index of the ramstage component in the verified
	  firmware block.

config VBOOT_REFCODE_INDEX
	hex "Reference code firmware index"
	default 1
	depends on VBOOT_VERIFY_FIRMWARE
	help
	  This is the index of the reference code component in the verified
	  firmware block.

config VBOOT_BOOT_LOADER_INDEX
	hex "Bootloader component index"
	default 0
	depends on VBOOT_VERIFY_FIRMWARE
	help
	  This is the index of the bootloader component in the verified
	  firmware block.

config VBOOT_SECURE_OS_INDEX
	hex "ARM64 Secure OS index"
	default 0x5
	depends on VBOOT_VERIFY_FIRMWARE
	help
	  Secure OS software component used on ARM64 machines.

config VBOOT_BL31_INDEX
	hex "ARM64 BL31 index"
	default 0x4
	depends on VBOOT_VERIFY_FIRMWARE
	help
	  This is the index of the BL31 program on ARM64 machines.

config VBOOT_DYNAMIC_WORK_BUFFER
	bool "Vboot's work buffer is dynamically allocated."
	default y if ARCH_ROMSTAGE_X86_32
	default n
	depends on VBOOT_VERIFY_FIRMWARE
	help
	  This option is used when there isn't enough pre-main memory
	  ram to allocate the vboot work buffer. That means vboot verification
	  is after memory init and requires main memory to back the work
	  buffer.
